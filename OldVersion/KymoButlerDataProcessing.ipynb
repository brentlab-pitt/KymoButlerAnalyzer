    "# KymoButler Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "After using KymoButler (AI program that analyzes kymographs made by Max Jakobs: https://github.com/MaxJakobs/KymoButler) to batch analyze your kymographs, it should output an excel file for each kymograph analyzed that contains different data about said kymograph (track duration, track displacement, start2end velocity, frame2frame velocity). The following python scripts will process and compile this data, it will sort the different metrics by direction (anterograde, retrograde, and total), then compile the different metrics for each kymograph result onto a master excel file. For example, it will compile the anterograde start2end velocity for each kymograph result onto one new excel. It saves all these compiled results into a folder called kymoresults. "
